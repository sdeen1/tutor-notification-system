Students can get help from tutors by entering a digital queue

This project was created for a tutoring program for times when there was high volume or shy students who wanted to get the attention of a tutor.  Students can enter the queue and after a tutor has helped the student, they can remove the student from the list.  There is also a clear queue feature for when the session is over and all students can be removed.
